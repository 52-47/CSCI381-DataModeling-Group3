# Group Discussion on Domains, Datatypes, Defaults, Validations, Schemas, Sequences. - 10/23/2023 
- As a group we traversed through each entity of the model one at a time and picked apart every attribute.
- We discussed the most appropriate data type for each attribute and created domains, defaults, validation rules as needed.
- We created schema objects and a base default for next values of sequences
- Each domain is mapped to a physical schema of the same name as the domain parent making it fully qualified.
