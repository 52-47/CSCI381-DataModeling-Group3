# eStreamingMovies Project 1

- The group Erwin Model for the project submitted by the group project leader only.
- Make sure to make use of your business rules with: 
    - defaults
    - validation rules 
    - fully qualified domains (User defined Datatypes) 
        - using dDomainName and sdDomainName with the physical side mapping the Domain Parent to a SchemaName.
- Be really judicious in setting Attribute\Column datatype sizes for memory and disk consideration.
- Create the FET ddl from the group Erwin Model and create it in SQL Server, then back it up and submit in your VHDX files.
