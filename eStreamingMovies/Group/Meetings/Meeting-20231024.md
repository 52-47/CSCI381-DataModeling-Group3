# Group Discussion on trade offs concerning the benefits of a large number of tightly coupled domains vs a small # of loosely coupled domains. - 10/24/2023
- We have decided that we would prefer to loosely couple our defaults/constraints to columns, and consolidate (certain) domains with equal data types into one.
- A problem was discovered in erwin when trying to use a base default for the next value of sequence objects.
	- [%AttFieldName] does not populate in the DDL when used in a base type for sequence objects.
	- This was resolved by creating individual defaults for each sequence Id and hardcoding the column value in.
- We have scheduled one more group meeting in the evening to perform final checks on the data model and add any missing info.
- A task list will be created to divided individual presentation work.
