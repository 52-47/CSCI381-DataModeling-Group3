# Group Discussion on First Steps - 10/21/2023

## Tasks:
1. Select a Group Model to use. 
    - Push individual work for Project 1 (if you haven't already) to our group repo in the directory: eStreamingMovies/Individual/%YOURNAME
    - Discuss the individual models in the repo and come to a consensus on which one to go forward with.
    - Review and define business logic of the model.
    - (Zoom meeting scheduled for Sunday 10/22/2023 @ 9pm)

2. Divide up the work/presentation into reviewing and defining: 
   - model selection,
   - business logic,
   - CDM,LDM,PDM overview,
   - schemas, 
   - entities/tables, 
   - attributes/columns, 
   - relationships, 
   - domains (& mappings to schemas in PDM), 
   - default values, 
   - validation rules, 
   - sequence objects,
   - ...etc. 
to support the business logic.

**
Be mindful of assignment instructions: 
" - Make sure to make use of your business rules with defaults, validation rules, fully qualified domains (User defined Datatypes) using dDomainName and sdDomainName with the physical side mapping the Domain Parent to a SchemaName. Be really judicious in setting Attribute\Column datatype sizes for memory and disk consideration."
**

3. Create DDL & instantiate the model in SQLServer2019 Database.
4. Make a backup of the database (.bak)
5. Put all files (our entire git repo) and presentation on vhdx and drop it in a cloud storage.
6. Submit <= Sunday 10/29/2023
