# Group Discussion on Model Selection - 10/23/2023:

- After assesssing individual models, the group has unanimously decided to use Ralph's model as a starting point for our group model.  
- Before our next meeting, I will prepare an excel spreadsheet for the breakdown of schemas, tables, attributes, domains, defaults, validation rules and sequence objects.
- Group meetings scheduled for 10/23/2023 & 10/24/2023 to confirm the business logic of the model and review/update all properties.
- After model is updated and agreed on, we will divide the presentation work into sections for each member.
